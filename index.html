        <h1>Christian's Story</h1>
        <p class="story-subtitle">A Personal Account of Bullying's Impact</p>
        
        <div class="story-content">
            <p class="story-intro">I was already tired when I walked into that classroom.</p>
            
            <p>College was supposed to feel like a fresh start, but for me, it wasn't. There was one person who made sure of that. Day after day, small comments, mocking looks, and constant pressure built up inside me. I told myself to ignore it. I told myself to be patient. I told myself to be the bigger person.</p>
            
            <p>I knew he had autism, and I tried to understand that. I really did. I reminded myself to be careful, to be kind, to let things pass. But understanding someone doesn't make the pain disappear. Being patient doesn't erase how it feels to be humiliated over and over again.</p>
            
            <p class="story-highlight">That day, something inside me cracked.</p>
            
            <p>We were in the same room, the air heavy and quiet. I remember my hands shaking. My chest felt tight, like I couldn't breathe properly. Then it happened — my thoughts stopped making sense. It was like a switch flipped. My vision blurred, darkened, and the noise in my head became louder than anything else.</p>
            
            <p class="story-emphasis">I stood up.</p>
            
            <p>I don't remember thinking. I don't remember deciding. I only remember the moment afterward — people shouting, someone pulling me away, my heart pounding like it wanted to escape my chest. The room felt unreal, like I had stepped outside myself and watched something terrible happen.</p>
            
            <p class="story-highlight">And then the anger disappeared.<br>What replaced it was worse.</p>
            
            <p>Guilt hit me all at once. Heavy. Crushing. I kept thinking, <em>Why did I do that? That's not who I am.</em> My hands felt weak. My stomach twisted. I wanted to take everything back, rewind time, disappear.</p>
            
            <p class="story-emphasis">In the guidance office, I finally broke down.</p>
            
            <p>I cried — not because I got in trouble, but because I was ashamed. Because I hurt someone I never wanted to hurt. Because losing control scared me more than the bullying ever did. I tried to explain that my mind went blank, that my vision turned dark, but words felt useless compared to the damage already done.</p>
            
            <div class="story-lesson">
                <p><strong>That day taught me something painful but important:</strong> anger doesn't always announce itself. Sometimes it builds quietly until it explodes. And even when you're hurting, even when you feel pushed too far, the consequences don't disappear just because you regret them.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p class="story-closing">I'm still learning how to carry that memory. Not to excuse what I did — but to understand it, to make sure it never happens again.</p>
            
            <div class="story-final">
                <p><strong>Because guilt means I care.<br>And caring means I can still choose to be better.</strong></p>
